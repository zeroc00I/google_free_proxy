# Google_free_proxy
A simple script to retrieve pages through 6 Google servers without any authentication.

## Why
I only noticed this behavior a few days ago and decided to create this because sometimes I just want a straightforward IP rotation without any frills

As of now, you can only exit through 6 IP addresses:

## Usage
To use the script, simply run:
```
python3 google_proxy.py -i host_file
```
In the example image provided, the input file was filled with:
```
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
http://ipv4.icanhazip.com
```
